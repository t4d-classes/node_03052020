3. Load the page and ensure everything loads without an error, there will be no data

4. Implement the REST API to display the table of cars and to add a car. For the table there is both a refresh and delete functionality which needs to be implemented. You will used the same file-based storage approach that we used with the colors. Setup the car REST API as its own router.
